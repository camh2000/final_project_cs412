# Weighted Graph Problems (TSP, Longest Path)

## Overview

This solution provides both exact and approximate algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Longest Path Problem (LPP) on weighted graphs. The solution is implemented in Python.

## Files

- `exact_solution.py`: Contains the exact solution algorithms.
- `approximation_solution.py`: Contains the approximation solution algorithms.
- `test_cases/`: Contains test cases.
- `run_test_cases.sh`: A shell script for running all test cases.

## Running the Programs

### Exact Solution

To run the exact solution for TSP, use the following command:

```bash
python3 exact_solution.py <input_file> tsp
